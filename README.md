# Your Danang Bus

The idea come from the first time I see this website: 
http://ecobus.danang.gov.vn/web/guest/homepublish

It's too hard for everybody to find their bus, to go to where we want. 
So, I decided to build this website as a non-profit, public and open sources website. 
Main Features: 
- Users are able to find expected Bus as fast as they want
- The steps that help users during the trip
  - Show users the way to a Bus Stop
  - How many time remaining until the Bus comes
  - Where users are when users are on the Bus
  - Time to get to destination
- Payment: buy monthly ticket
